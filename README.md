# Neighborhood map
Project 5 from Udacity Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree.

Open index.html to run the project.

### Requirements
> You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places you’d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations.
